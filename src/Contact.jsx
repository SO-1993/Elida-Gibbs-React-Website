        Elida Gibbs are always on the lookout for new players to join our squad.
        Following promotion last from Division 3 in the 2023/24 season, we are
        ambitious to continue our jouney up the divisions. Whether you're an
        experienced footballer, fresh from underage football, or looking to get
        back into the game after a period of time out, we'd love to hear from
        you. We're a good bunch of lads who enjoy competitive football, having a
        laugh, and supporting each other both on and off the pitch. Come and be
        part of a welcoming and passionate team!
